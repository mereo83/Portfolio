          <h3>What it takes to be a FullStack Developer?</h3>
          <p>
            Gone are the days where you just needed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
            be qualified as a Web Developer. In this current era of
            frontend/backend frameworks and conceptual websites you will need a
            lot more than the basic frontend.
          </p>
          <p>
            These days HTML, CSS, and JS are a requirement for every Web
            Developer out there. Apart from this, you will need to learn a CSS
            framework such as BootStrap or Tailwind CSS. A lot of people are
            ashamed for using a frontend framework but it is absolutely fine as
            long as it gets the work done.
          </p>
          <p>
            After learning a framework, try learning MERN (Mongo DB, Express JS,
            React JS, Node JS) stack or MEAN (Mongo DB, Express JS, Angular JS,
            Node JS) stack. These days tech stacks are highly valued in the web
            development industry.
